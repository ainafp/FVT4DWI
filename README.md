# FVT4DWI: FVTool for Diffusion-weighted Imaging

## Quantification of Structural Brain Connectivity via a Conductance Model

This is a toolbox to study structural brain connectivity using a combination 
of differential Maxwell’s equations and Kirchhoff’s circuit laws, resulting in 
an equation similar to the heat equation. By solving this partial differential equation
for a certain current configuration between 2 voxels, we find the potential map
for that specific configuration. We further compute the electric conductance 
between each pair of voxels from potential maps, to which all diffusion paths between the pair contribute.  
The same measure can also be computed between a pair of regions of interest (ROIs) 
instead of voxels, by distributing the currents among the ROI voxels.

### How do I use it?

You can find 
* toy examples with different shapes, and plot conductance interactively [here](Examples/example_toy_2D_shapes.md).
* an example of how to interactively plot conductance using the Fibercup data [here](Examples/example_fibercup_3D.md).
* a generic example for structural brain connectivity in [Examples/Connectivity/run_conductance_model.m](Examples/Connectivity/run_conductance_model.m)

This toolbox is a fork of [FVTool](https://github.com/simulkade/FVTool), and was extended for dealing with tensors and 
modified for its use in structural connectivity settings.
